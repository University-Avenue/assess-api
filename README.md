# assess-api
The back-end codebase

## What it does
Conduct remote, real-time technical programming interviews with candidates right in monday.com -- all while tracking a candidate's progress. We hope that Assess can bridge the gap between HR and Engineering teams, enabling them to consolidate their data in a single place!

It all starts with the candidate completing the job posting's form. Once the application is submitted, it automatically creates a new row in the "New Applicants" group. 

Through the use of monday.com automations, if ever an applicant's phone interview or in-person interview status changes that applicant will move to the appropriate group. 

Once the candidate reaches the technical phone interview, an interviewer simply needs to do is share the Code Editor board with the candidate. The Code Editor board has a Code Editor view, which includes:

* Auto code completion
* Complete code execution
* Support for 5 languages
* Access to console output
* Error notification 

Our Code Editor allows candidates to showcase their abilities in an environment that resembles most to that of a work environment. Our tool lets candidates write programs that run. It's simple, yet powerful. Hiring candidates gets easier when you give them the best experience! 

Prior to the interview starting, the interviewer can choose a technical question using the dropdown provided. This dropdown is populated using the Questions board -- a prebuilt board that comes with the Assess template. Although this may seem like a minor feature, it allows an engineering team to work alongside each other and build a repository of interview questions. Having a single repository means one team can be inspired by another's set of questions.


In addition to providing an enjoyable candidate experience, consolidating the technical interview with the recruitment pipeline in one place makes an interviewer's life that much easier. No longer does one need to copy over notes.

It should be noted, that our Assess app is not limited to interviews for engineering roles. It can most definitely support non-technical interviews. Consolidating applications into one location allows for much smoother communication between various teams and HR.
